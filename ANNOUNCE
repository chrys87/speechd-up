SpeechD-Up 0.3
==============

The Brailcom organization is happy to announce the availability of SpeechD-Up
0.3 developed as a part of the Free(b)Soft project. Please read `What is new'
and `NOTES' bellow.

* What is SpeechD-Up?

SpechD-Up is a very simple simple interface from Speakup to Speech Dispatcher
making it possible to use Speakup with software synthesis. Speakup is a
kernel-based screen reader allowing blind and visually impaired people to use
the computer.

* What is new in 0.3?

 - Support for the 'Read All' command in Speakup
	(thanks to Michael McDonald)

 - Bugfixes

 NOTES:
    - You need to upgrade to Speech Dispatcher 0.6 before installing
      this version of SpeechD-Up. Please visit
	http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd

    - Currently, it is possible to use 'Read All' with Festival, one of
      the most advanced Free Software TTS system. The other simpler ones
      don't support index marking. You need to update Speakup to a recent
      version, if you like to try.
