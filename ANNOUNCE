SpeechD-Up 0.4
==============

The Brailcom organization is happy to announce the availability of SpeechD-Up
0.4 developed as a part of the Free(b)Soft project. Please read `What is new'
and `NOTES' bellow.

* What is SpeechD-Up?

SpechD-Up is a very simple interface from Speakup to Speech Dispatcher
making it possible to use Speakup with software synthesis. Speakup is a
kernel-based screen reader allowing blind and visually impaired people to use
the computer.

* What is new in 0.4?

 - Internationalization for all unibyte encodings! It is now possible to use
   Speakup with different languages, as long as the written form is representable
   in a unibyte (e.g. iso-8859-) encoding and the language is supported by your
   synthesizer. Please see the documentation.
	(thanks to Gilles Casse)

 - Keys and characters typed by the user are now a separate event for Speech
   Dispatcher. This allows the various synthesizers to do caching, their own
   language appropriate punctuation and capital letters handling. Also sound
   icons for letters and symbols are now supported.

 NOTES:
    - You need to upgrade to Speech Dispatcher 0.6 or 0.6.1 before installing
      this version of SpeechD-Up. Please visit
	http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd

    - Advanced functions like caching of synthesized letters and sound icons
      are supported only in some synthesizers in Speech Dispatcher, currently
      Festival and IBM TTS. We are working on such support for eSpeak, but it
      is not ready yet.

    - If you do not like the new behavior in reading punctuation and capital
      letters, or if your synthesizer doesn't support such functions, please
      invoke speechd-up with the -t option to revert to the behavior of the
      previous versions.

    - If you have problems with internationalization, please examine the logfile.
      Probably you are running and older version of Speakup.
