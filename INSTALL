The requirements:
=================

You will need these components to compile and run speechd-speakup: 
 - Speech Dispatcher (http://www.freebsoft.org)
 - Speakup (http://www.linux-speakup.org)

Only if you are building from CVS, you also need these:
 - automake 1.7+, autoconf, pkg-config and libtool

We recommend to also install these packages:
 - festival (http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/)

Building SpeechD-Up:
===========================

To compile the SpeechD-Up, simply extract the distribution archive and
change to speechd-<version> directory and run "make all" command as
follows:

 $ tar -xzvf speechd-up-@VERSION.tar.gz
 $ cd speechd-up-@VERSION
 $ ./configure
 $ make all

If it doesn't work, try the following:

 $ cd speechd-@VERSION
 $ aclocal && autoconf && autoheader && automake -a && automake
 $ ./configure
 $ make

(You can use ./build.sh instead of the auto-toolchain) 

If everything worked ok, you can install all the parts to the default
path by running (as root):

 $ make install

If something doesn't work, please contact us on speechd@freebsoft.org .
