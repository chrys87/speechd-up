2004-04-16 Kirk Reiser <kirk@braille.uwo.ca>

	*  Modified Makefile.am to remove the dependency on libglib which isn't
	needed and was causing major problems trying to find the correct
	version of the library.  

	* Modified configure.in to add a test for libspeechd.h which does
	not get installed by make install of speech dispatcher.  

	
	* Also modified the INSTALL file to clean up English slightly.
	
2004-04-14 Kirk Reiser <kirk@braille.uwo.ca>

        * The changes include modifying two counters which were causing
	single characters from being processed.  

	* Changed the call to spd_say from priority SPD_TEXT to
	SPD_MESSAGE because the text priority were cancelling the previous
	call rather than queueing the messages.  

	* Changed the spd_stop call to spd_cancell() which flushes all
	pending messages rather than just the one being spoken. 

	* Changed the handling of relative values in command set to work
	more like they are intended to operate.  

	* Moved the reset test to process_command because resets are
	supposed to be regular commands.  It still doesn't work quite
	right but at least it's in the correct place now.  Changed the
	handling of values in the parse_buf() because it was cutting off
	the last character in buffer.
